# Welcome to our Project!
Today team Onyx is making an Abortion App for women who want to have a safe Abortion.

## About the App
The name of the app is called Your Choice.
The inspiration for this app was a way to help women who ended up getting pregnant, whether it
be of their own voilation or not, get to a safe place that allows them to safely continue their
bright future ahead of them.
